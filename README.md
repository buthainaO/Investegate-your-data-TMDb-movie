# Introduction 
For this project we’re interested in analyzing TMDb movie dataset and find patterns between different features and specifically answer the following questions:
- What are the best years for movies?
- Does a high vote average necessarily mean a more popular movie?
- Who are the top directors with the highest vote average?
- Which are the genres with higher vote average?

# Dataset 
TMDb movie dataset is a dataset with more than 10000 rows and 21 columns.

# Findings summary
- We have discovered many valuable information from this analysis and we answered the research questions. The first three questions were directly related to the release date, we can see that there's a decreasing trend for the vote average and the best vote average of movies starts from 1960 till mid 1970’s. The 2000’s to 2010’s wasn’t the years for movie voters but it started increasing in 2015. Then, we can see that the production of movies is increasing every year and from late 2010’s till 2015 is its highest. The last chart visualizes movie revenue over years. It's an increasing trend, but some years like the 80’s and 2000’s no increase was observed. Highest revenue was in mid 2010’s.

The last three research questions examine the vote average relationship with different variables. The more popular a movie doesn't necessarily mean a higher vote average. The top voted movies directed by:-

Frank Darabont
Jonathan Demme
Francis Ford Coppola
Damien Chazelle
David Fincher
Christopher Nolan
Quentin Tarantino
Robert Zemeckis
Steven Spielberg
The genres with highest vote average are Documentary, War, History.
